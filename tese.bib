A gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom environment is proposed in this study. The objective of the study is to enhance students’ motivations, learning achievements and their perceptions of the designed environment. In the study, a true experimental design was used. The study was conducted with 61 undergraduate students taking a Physics-2 course. The experimental group students learned in the gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom environment, while the control group students learned with the ﬂipped classroom approach without a gamiﬁcation strategy. Data were collected from a physics motivation questionnaire, electromagnetism achievement test and semi structured interviews. The experimental results indicate that the students from the experimental group had a signiﬁcantly increased motivation for the classroom and learning achievements in comparison to the students in the control group. Moreover, it has been determined that the students’ opinions on the gamiﬁed classroom environment were positive. Additionally, the students interviewed stated that the approach had positive effects on their motivation for physics class. The results of this study can assist lecturers and instructors in integrating the gamiﬁcation strategy to the ﬂipped classroom approach.},

We present a study in which a college course was gamified, by including experience points, levels, badges, challenges and leaderboards. The study was five years long, where the first three were non-gamified years, and the last two regarded two successive experiments of our gamified approach. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compared data from both gamified and non-gamified years, using different performance measures. Results show significant improvements in terms of attention to reference materials, online participation and proactivity. They also suggest that our approach can reduce grade discrepancies among students and help them score better. Modeling course activities with game challenges and properly distributing those over the term seem to enhance this effect.},

	abstract = {Flipped learning can provide more in-class time for students to practice and apply knowledge and to receive feedback from peers and teachers. However, empirical studies have reported several problems that may occur with ﬂipped classroom activities, including the failure of students to access out-of-class learning materials. Students who do not complete out-of-class work beneﬁt little from the subsequent in-class discussion and problem-solving activities. This study oﬀers a new contribution by exploring whether gamiﬁcation could be a strategy to motivate students to participate in more out-of-class activities without forfeiting quality of work. We applied crucial aspects of ﬁve motivation theories to propose a goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration (GAFCC) gamiﬁcation design model. We then implemented and tested this theory-driven model in two quasi-experimental studies involving postgraduate students. Collective results from the two experiments revealed that (a) the GAFCC class completed signiﬁcantly more pre- and postclass activities than the control class and (b) the GAFCC class produced higher quality work than the control class. Participants’ perceptions of gamiﬁcation were also collected through interviews, and reported in this study. This evidence supports a call for further research into the use of the GAFCC model in ﬂipped classroom implementation.},

This study held an “understanding sequence” for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30 s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56\% to 78.89\%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system increased competitive spirit, as well as interest.},

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identiﬁed as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the ﬂipped MOOC, applying the ﬂipped classroom approach to the MOOCs’ design and making use of gamiﬁcation and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a ﬂipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments. Our ﬁndings support the idea that MOOCs can be enriched by the orchestration of a ﬂipped classroom approach in combination with the support of gamiﬁcation and learning analytics.},

This instructional approach combines video-based learning outside the classroom and interactive group learning activities inside the classroom. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of flipped classroom studies in K-12 education. Particularly, we put emphasis on revealing and addressing the potential challenges of flipped classroom approach. Fifteen journal publications of K-12 flipped classrooms were analyzed in terms of their flipped learning activities, student achievement, student attitude, and challenges encountered. The results suggested that a variety of pre-class (e.g., online exercises) and in-class (e.g., brief review, individual practices) activities were provided in addition to instructional videos and small-group activities respectively. The use of flipped classroom approach in K-12 education yielded a neutral or positive impact on student achievement when compared to traditional classroom. Mixed results of student attitude toward flipped classroom approach were discovered. Challenges of implementing flipped classrooms were identified and categorized into student-related challenges, faculty challenges, and operational challenges. Based on the suggestions of previous studies together with relevant empirical supports, we propose a rudimentary flipped classroom model and a set of 10 guidelines to address these challenges. Finally, several recommendations of future research are provided.},

This storytelling template presents the stages of inner metamorphosis undergone by the protagonist after being called to an adventure. In a simpliﬁed version, this journey is divided into three acts separated by two crucial moments. Here we propose a discrete-time dynamical system for representing the protagonist’s evolution. The suffering along the journey is taken as the control parameter of this system. The bifurcation diagram exhibits stationary, periodic and chaotic behaviors. In this diagram, there are transition from ﬁxed point to chaos and transition from limit cycle to ﬁxed point. We found that the values of the control parameter corresponding to these two transitions are in quantitative agreement with the two critical moments of the three-act hero’s journey identiﬁed in 10 movies appearing in the list of the 200 worldwide highest-grossing ﬁlms.},

	abstract = {This study explores interactive digital storytelling in a university hybrid course. Digital stories leverage imagery and narrative-based content to explore concepts, while appealing to millennials. When digital storytelling is used as the main source of course content, tensions arise regarding how to engage and support student learning while holding them accountable for watching the video. We explore interactive video as a way to mitigate and engage with these issues. The context is a hybrid sustainability course for preservice teachers that used digital stories in a conventional format in which students could start, stop, and pause the video at will, as well as an interactive format with all the same features, plus programmed pauses for required understanding checks. A survey of students (n = 223) indicated they believed interactive digital stories supported engagement, scaffolded learning, and increased learning gains, but did not increase accountability. Evaluation of quiz performance indicated they recalled significantly more with interactive videos, compared to conventional videos. Implications for practice are discussed.},

Our findings give rise to a number of design criteria for e-Learning and blended course that address the motivation gap in order to increase the number students that are able to self-regulate their studies and stay or become motivated by the course as defined by Dan Pink’s motivational factors: autonomy, mastery and purpose [3].},

	abstract = {We evaluated the use of gamiﬁcation to facilitate a student-centered learning environment within an undergraduate Year 2 Personal and Professional Development (PPD) course. In addition to face-to-face classroom practices, an information technology-based gamiﬁed system with a range of online learning activities was presented to students as support material. The implementation of the gamiﬁed course lasted two academic terms. The subsequent evaluation from a cohort of 136 students indicated that student performance was signiﬁcantly higher among those who participated in the gamiﬁed system than in those who engaged with the nongamiﬁed, traditional delivery, while behavioral engagement in online learning activities was positively related to course performance, after controlling for gender, attendance, and Year 1 PPD performance. Two interesting phenomena appeared when we examined the inﬂuence of student background: female students participated signiﬁcantly more in online learning activities than male students, and students with jobs engaged signiﬁcantly more in online learning activities than students without jobs. The gamiﬁed course design advocated in this work may have signiﬁcant implications for educators who wish to develop engaging technology-mediated learning environments that enhance students’ learning, or for a broader base of professionals who wish to engage a population of potential users, such as managers engaging employees or marketers engaging customers.},

Just as a hero draws on different archetypes during the journey, a researcher moves through phases and must draw upon different strengths. In this article, the six archetypes that Pearson (1998) links to the hero’s journey are described. Then, each phase of a qualitative research study is described, followed by reflection on which of Pearson’s six archetypes were active. Discussion focuses on how other archetypes could have been helpful in each phase, as well as how other researchers could use this process of archetypal reflectivity to make their work more authentic and intentional.},

	abstract = {This is a pilot study aimed at examining students' learning performance and perceived motivation between a gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom and a non-gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom instructional model, based on the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups of the gamiﬁed ﬂipped and non-gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while assessment 2 and 3 were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (t = 5.54, p = .007 {\textless} .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 {\textless} .05). In the present study, the ﬁndings conﬁrm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the gamiﬁed ﬂip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement. Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students during the gamiﬁcation activities by collecting points and badges as many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamiﬁed ﬂip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.},

It proposes the thesis that because people respond - instinctively and intuitively - to certain recurring story patterns and character archetypes, lawyers should systematically and deliberately integrate into their storytelling the larger picture of their clients' goals by subtly portraying their individual clients as heroes on a particular life path. This strategy is not merely a device to make the story more interesting but provides a scaffold to influence the judge at the unconscious level by providing a metaphor for universal themes of struggle and growth.},

These mechanics have been applied without reference to a theoretical model dedicated to this type of education. The objective of the paper is to propose a model for a gamified platform for online education that contributes to a more participatory learning, taking into account the different student profiles. Based on literature review about approaches to gamification systems design, a set of steps was followed in order to develop a generic model for a framework dedicated to online education. The model proposed is based on the Educational Gamification Design Principles proposed by Dicheva et al. (2015). The model may contribute to the promotion of participatory learning, taking into account the different student profiles. The results of such evaluation will be published in the future.},

	abstract = {Joseph Campbell is the mythographer of the last century who has congenially opened the mythological universe to both scholars and to a wide range of people searching for pathways to enlighten their lives. His elixir of life was to help people “see myth as a reflection of the one sublime adventure of life, and then to breathe new life into it” (Campbell, 2003, p. xiv). The hero’s journey is his gift, his “ultimate boon” (Campbell, 2008, p. 29) for the human condition and social world. It represents a universal motif which runs through virtually all kinds of change, transformation, and growth. The main objective of this special issue of the Journal of Genius and Eminence is to explore the multi-faceted potential of the hero’s journey and perhaps shed new light on it. The introduction gives an overview of Campbell’s ultimate boon and a summary of each of the 12 articles that follow. Distinguished scientists and outstanding practitioners have joined this journey in tribute to Campbell and the 30th anniversary of his death. The contributors take us far and wide, exploring different ways to explore Campbell’s thoughts, allowing insights into the nuances and subtleties of his mythological world, and striking new ways to illuminate the Campbellian universe.},

	title = {Flipped {Gaming}: {The} {Teachers} {Role} {When} {Using} the {Students} as {Content} {Providers}},
	abstract = {In order to activate students and make them active contributors in a class, the concept of “Flipped Classroom” has been used at several Universities, also at The Inland University of Applied Sciences Norway. Flipping the classroom and making the students contribute, and being active, has supported the students learning outcome. Generally, when using games for learning, the game scenario is either decided by the lecturer/teacher, or defined by the designers and/or producers of the game used. In this paper we will explore how the teachers/lecturers role changes when the scenarios to be played in the game environment are defined and developed by the students themselves. The methodological approach is mainly qualitative and the data are observations from gaming sessions, minutes from review processes and interviews with faculty staff responsible for the course. The paper will present how the lecturer/teacher changes role from being the center of attention and the provider of knowledge, to a facilitator that both empower the students and enables the students to contribute towards developing increased understanding and enhanced learning outcome. By enabling the students to contribute in such a way, the support towards the reflection processes described by Donald Schön in his work “The reflective practitioner” from 1991, is being supported in all stages. The reflection before action is when they discuss and agree on scenario, they need to reflect in action upon action, and they need to reflect on action when finished gaming. These reflection processes need to be facilitated in order to support the learning process and when flipping the gaming, this is one of the roles of the facilitator; the lecturer/teacher. The paper will present a project called “Seed corn 2017 – Pedagogical Use of Games in Crisis Management Education”, using a course at The Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Campus Rena, Norway, and the results from the research.},

@article{zhang_archetype_nodate,
	title = {Archetype and {Allegory} in {Journey} to the {West}},
	abstract = {The Journey to the West (西游记) is one of the masterworks of classic Chinese fiction. It was written by Wu Cheng‘en (吴承恩) in the 16th century CE. Many of the scholars, both Chinese and Western, who have studied the narrative of this Ming era (1368-1644) novel, have considered it to be an epic of myth and fantasy, heavily laden with allegorical meaning. Most scholars have chosen to interpret the novel by means of an encompassing framework of meaning rooted in the convergence of the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. I propose to look at the Journey’s narrative structure as a heroic adventure or monomyth of the kind proposed by Joseph Campbell, following the insights of Carl Jung on the nature of the collective unconscious. To analyze the component parts of the quest story that forms the bulk of the novel‘s narrative, I shall turn to Vladimir Propp‘s categorization of the functioning of elements of plot and character in his morphology of folktales. I shall also argue that the Journey is not an allegory that serves the beliefs and practices of a number of religions and philosophies, but a specifically Buddhist allegory. The Journey is seen as intentionally composed of symbols, images, and codes that function to project a heroic adventure with a complex pattern of meaning, primarily representing the eternal human struggle for identity and a fully realized existence, that are Buddhist in nature.},

The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners’ motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy.

	abstract = {This collection engages with questions of influence, a vexed and problematic concept whose intellectual history is both ancient and vast. It examines a range of texts written in French, sometimes in dialogue with visual/musical works, drawn mainly from the eighteenth century onwards. Connections are made with related work in a range of disciplines. Questions of Influence is a major contribution to, and updating of, our understanding of the ways in which 'influence' works not only in literature but also in other art-forms, and in relationships between these. Exploring 'influence' in a newly sophisticated way, the book draws on a wide range of European writers, artists and thinkers, and showcases numerous talented critics working at the cutting edge of their fields. It will be indispensable both for those working on the individual figures who form the case studies of the book and for those who want to re-conceptualise the slippery concept of influence and the lateral, as well as direct, modes in which it operates. Each chapter is beautifully presented and lucidly argued, and the whole book demonstrates remarkable intellectual versatility and orginality.},

	abstract = {Motivation is underappreciated in self-regulation theories (as is true in social personality psychology at large). This paper reviews the role of motivation in the context of the strength, or limited-resource, model of self-control in several domains. Sacrificing one desire in order to pursue another is more difficult when the incipient response is strongly motivated, a notion that highlights the struggle between urges and restraints. A reduction in ego resources can be temporarily overcome by strong motivation – nevertheless, ego depletion is not solely a loss of motivation: Recent experiments indicate that regulatory resources are rooted in physical energy stores. Motivational conflicts, especially the clash between selfish motives and behaviors that promote social acceptance, set the stage for the necessity of self-regulation and the circumstances in which ego depletion is most likely.},

	abstract = {In human-computer interaction, the trend towards gamiﬁcation is part of the shift of focus from usability to the more holistic approach of user experience. Gamiﬁcation is "the use of game elements in non-game contexts" and is increasingly used in a variety of domains such as crowd sourcing, health care, sustainability, sports and learning. In today’s Internet, consumer loyalty is low and high expectations are placed upon positive effects of gamiﬁcation. Despite its widespread use, only a small number of studies have examined the phenomenon empirically and it is still unclear if and how gamiﬁcation is able to live up to expectations. A promising approach is to study gamiﬁcation from the perspective of motivation theories. The extensive research on rewards and research in the ﬁeld of video games makes the theory of self-determination a viable starting point. Likewise, the concept of ﬂow has strengths when it comes to designing for an optimal user experience and usability. Following the approach of self-determination theory, the possible effects of personal, situational and contextual factors will be discussed and recommendations for design and possible research will be given.},

	abstract = {Instruction in English is a priority around the globe, but instructional methodologies have not always kept pace with the changing needs of students. To explore the beneﬁts of the ﬂipped classroom model for learners of English as a Foreign Language, the researchers used ﬂipped learning and Wen’s Output-driven/Input-enabled model to design a holistic oral training course that included extensive online written and verbal communication for the learning of a wide range of English idioms. The participants were 48 sophomore English majors in two required English oral training classes. A within-subjects research design exposed all participants to learning English idioms by ﬂipped learning, using the LINE smartphone app, and by conventional instruction. A mixed research method was employed, using multiple sources of data collection, including pre- and post-tests on idioms, two questionnaires (“Perception of Flipped Learning Experience” and “Technology Acceptance Model”), the teachers’ in-class observations, and semi-structured focus-group interviews. The results revealed that the theory-based ﬂipped instruction using online written and oral interaction not only enhanced the participants’ motivation, making them more active in using idioms in class, but also signiﬁcantly improved their idiomatic knowledge, indicating that the ﬂipped learning was successful in achieving the instructional goals of the class. The authors present insights into the impact of theory-based ﬂipped learning on motivation and idiomatic acquisition; student impressions of the online platform used, LINE; and offer recommendations for practice.},

Various studies point in different directions. However, blended learning outperforms the traditional classroom in student performance and satisfaction. A ﬂipped classroom is one type of blended learning. For more than 20 years, this approach has been used at a European executive MBA (EMBA) program delivering online content combined with six residential weeks where students collaborate and reﬂect upon their online learning. Our research examined the overall setup of this program, and assessed one course in depth. As part of the course—International Management—an intercultural negotiation project was chosen to highlight the integration of online and ofﬂine activities. The ﬂipped classroom is a demonstration of the reform-based teaching approach. The power of reform-based learning in executive education is the engaging combination of practice and theory, which improves the performance of executives. The participants considered the ﬂipped approach exciting, dynamic, and insightful. The emphasis on a negotiation process involving classmates from around the world increased their global understanding. Beginning with a negotiation experience in the digital story project gave them a better appreciation of the relevant theories, techniques, and applications. Focusing on the practice of international negotiation and a cross-cultural analysis with reﬂection on cultural intelligence improved the competencies of the participants both during the course and after it.},

The study presents a reference matrix for gamification applications based on a framework of game elements (dynamics, mechanics and components) seeking relations with segments/application areas that could make use of the gamification process. Besides the bibliographical research, some Grounded Theory techniques were used to gather, prepare and analyze data. Intermediate matrices allowed the discussion about aspects related to components, mechanics and game dynamics and the different segments/areas identified. The main matrix may serve as a reference model for gamification applications bearing in mind that different sets of elements may be combined in various ways; and that each segment/area has a potential set of combinations that depend on the clarity of business objectives. For example, the use of the "narratives" dynamics in the Education and Training segment could help not only the players, but also the developers regarding the stimulus, motivation and engagement needed to promote a teaching/learning process. Within the context of information architecture, the game mechanics is the critical element for engagement underpinning the play style and working directly on the user's perception. Future studies may add to this matrix previous information from users - which would affect the development of gamification applications - as well as information derived from the activity of the players, as cutouts towards a wide strategic proposal.},

	abstract = {Games and game elements are increasingly used by organizations to facilitate learning and motivation, often without a clear understanding how they actually achieve these effects. This may lead to the insufficient design and use of serious games as well as gamified applications. Since the development of such applications is usually expensive, high costs and few realized benefits might result. In order to avoid such unfavorable outcomes, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to learning and motivation. For this purpose, this study reviews research articles describing the use of games and game elements beyond entertainment and outlines their theoretical foundations. Based on the resulting insights, several theory-driven design guidelines for game-based learning and motivation are derived. This study therefore equips researchers with theoretical insights on how games and game elements facilitate learning and motivation, and practitioners with theory-driven design guidelines for their design and evaluation.},

The ego/ persona is incomplete and longing for the gift of completion, the shadow is the gift giver, and the anima is the gift. Here we begin to see the symbolism in humanity’s great myths of the dramas being played out between ego, persona, shadow, and anima/ animus. In our mythic stories, the one who stands between the hero and the treasure often mysteriously becomes, in fact, the gift giver: obstructing dragon guardian transforms into knowledgeable guide. With the treasure come new challenges, however; the hero can project any of these elements outwardly onto people or institutions and become entangled, or the seeker’s ego can identify with the successful search and become inflated. Or, following a path of transformation to a higher stage of human development, the hero can integrate the previously hidden and unknown depths of self.},

The JiTT method allowes the teacher know in advance those aspects that are most interesting or most dificult to understand for the students as well as their most urgent doubts. Finally, we have developed methods to use the urgent doubts of the students to generate formative feedback and activities to do in the classroom. In the method named “flipped learning forte” the teacher answer the urgent doubts of his students. In the method named ‘flip in colours’ the teacher classify the doubts by their posible utility in the classroom using a color code. With the combined application of these methods in university courses the failure rate of the students has decreased and the mean grade in the exams for the assessment of learning has increased in more than one standard deviation. The rate of students that attain the level of mastery has increased, as well as the student evaluations about the teachers of these courses.

	abstract = {Interactive digital storytelling is becoming a popular choice for information presentation in many fields. Its application spans from the media industry and business information visualization, through digital cultural heritage, serious games, education, to contemporary theater and visual arts. The benefits of this form of multimedia presentation in education are generally recognized, and several studies which explore and support the opinion have been conducted. In addition to discussing the benefits, we wanted to address the challenges of introducing interactive digital storytelling and serious games in the classroom. The challenge of the inherent ambiguity of edutainment, due to opposing features of education and entertainment, is augmented with different viewpoints of multidisciplinary team members. We specifically address the opposing views on artistic liberty, at one side, and technical constraints and historical facts, on the other. In this paper, we present the first findings related to these questions and hope to initiate further discussions in this area.},

Consequently, there is increasing interest in collecting information on the range and frequency of teaching practices at department-wide and institution-wide scales. To help facilitate this process, we present a new classroom observation protocol known as the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM or COPUS. This protocol allows STEM faculty, after a short 1.5-hour training period, to reliably characterize how faculty and students are spending their time in the classroom. We present the protocol, discuss how it differs from existing classroom observation protocols, and describe the process by which it was developed and validated. We also discuss how the observation data can be used to guide individual and institutional change.},

	abstract = {To test the hypothesis that lecturing maximizes learning and course performance, we metaanalyzed 225 studies that reported data on examination scores or failure rates when comparing student performance in undergraduate science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses under traditional lecturing versus active learning. The effect sizes indicate that on average, student performance on examinations and concept inventories increased by 0.47 SDs under active learning (n = 158 studies), and that the odds ratio for failing was 1.95 under traditional lecturing (n = 67 studies). These results indicate that average examination scores improved by about 6\% in active learning sections, and that students in classes with traditional lecturing were 1.5 times more likely to fail than were students in classes with active learning. Heterogeneity analyses indicated that both results hold across the STEM disciplines, that active learning increases scores on concept inventories more than on course examinations, and that active learning appears effective across all class sizes—although the greatest effects are in small (n ≤ 50) classes. Trim and fill analyses and fail-safe n calculations suggest that the results are not due to publication bias. The results also appear robust to variation in the methodological rigor of the included studies, based on the quality of controls over student quality and instructor identity. This is the largest and most comprehensive metaanalysis of undergraduate STEM education published to date. The results raise questions about the continued use of traditional lecturing as a control in research studies, and support active learning as the preferred, empirically validated teaching practice in regular classrooms.},

The central component of this approach was students' pre-lecture preparation of a short PowerPoint presentation in which they answered a few general conceptual questions about the coming lecture topic. The power of PowerPoint, it is argued, is about structuring student thought and student engagement before and during lectures, as well as giving students more power to be involved to shape content and interactivity of university lectures. The article concludes with some valuable lessons and pointers for course instructors across disciplines about the pedagogy and use of PowerPoint as an instructional method for enhancing student engagement and active learning.},

This paper reports on such an investigation with a cohort of 1,450 first year psychology students' who indicated whether they frequently attended lectures or not. The division helped ascertain differences and similarities in preferences for using online recordings. Overall, non-frequent attendees were more likely not to use lecture recordings (48.1\%) to make up a missed lecture than frequent attendees (34.3\%). Surprisingly, in the last week of semester, 29\% of students reported not yet accessing lecture recordings. Students had the intention to use lecture recordings as they envisaged these to be helpful for learning and commented that they would be adversely affected if recordings were not available. In fact, students are passionate about lecture recordings. Analytics show that after Lecture 7, each lecture recording attracted 600 or less unique visits (hits) supporting the finding that most students make strategic use of learning resources available within the blended learning environment.},

It intends to face the challenge of transfer to active learning, using mobile devices in face-to-face courses. Following a research undertaken at the Neri Bloomfield School of Design and Education (n = 67), the new model was found to be very successful. Students, who participated in the research, reported that courses based on TBAL principles, improved their learning process, were very experiential and had a significant contribution for better participation, collaboration and teamwork.The TBAL model was found to be applicable to courses based on text reading, in particular, but it may be also suitable for quantitative courses, subject to appropriate adjustments.},

In this humble study, students undergo an experimental process where they are asked to develop a software project. The latter is defined by a teacher-set deadline period in which students’ performed actions would be recorded to be used in the assessment process. To demonstrate the effectiveness of the developed system and the proposed approach for improving the soft skills, the prospective experiment was conducted at the level of a higher education institution. Over and above, the obtained results were highly satisfying and very encouraging. They also showed that the cognitive profiles and soft skills of most students were improved.},

Findings reveal that educational research on DF is focused on learning analytics, the study of digital presence and psychometric modeling. Likewise, the article reports on the scarce investigation of DF in Massive Open Online Courses (MOOCs) environments and highlights the multiple meanings of DF as an action and as a service, beyond the generalized conception of data. These findings suggest the importance of preparing educational institutions to implement DF use and management practices in order to favor processes that range from DF curation, to cognitive evaluation, digital equity, prediction of school success and/or failure, etc. Hence, DF meanings (data, action and service) could aid to generate proper administration and policy-making actions, placed at the service of all students and their educational communities.},

Recent work has demonstrated that educational escape games elicit high motivation and engagement on the part of the participants. Moreover, it has been shown that many participants experienced flow, a state of mind, which has been considered as beneficial for successful learning. However, due to its novelty, studies on the educational significance of such activities still appear to be sparse. In this work, we investigated whether escape games can be used as a teaching tool in the context of educational robotics, since both can be situated in the pedagogical currents of social-constructivism. To this end, we developed a prototype of an escape game using the educational robot Thymio and the visual programming language VPL and tested it with 61 subjects. Both quantitative and qualitative results showed that most participants highly appreciated the activity and agreed on the game’s usability for teaching. Moreover, a great majority agreed on having experienced flow while playing. We, therefore, suggest that escape games provide a favorable framework for educational robotic activities, promoting particularly self-regulated and collaborative learning.},

The students follow in the footsteps of Nicolas Leblanc, a young French chemist, who took part in a contest launched by the French Academy of Sciences in 1775 to produce industrial soda ash. By means of scientific puzzles, such as using the periodic table, balancing a reaction, drawing up a flowsheet, or performing simple mole calculations, students will access combinations of numbers that allow them to open mechanisms present in the room that give them access to other enigmas. Following a precise sequence (controlled by the teacher present in the room), the students will thus advance in groups by retracing the development of one of the first industrial processes in the world. Escaping from the room is not the end of the activity: a debriefing will highlight the key elements of the construction of this process and will indicate the resources for further research, notably on the environmental consequences of the Leblanc process and the passing of the alkali act, one of the first laws to limit atmospheric pollution in the world. To simplify the principle of classical “escape games”, a classroom version, based on an easily printable paper sheet and locked file folders, is proposed in this paper.},

	abstract = {Educators have now introduced the so called escape-games into their teaching or training practices. During a limited time, a team of learners collaboratively solves puzzles related to educational content. For learners, the aim consists of “escaping” from a room. For educators, an escape-game contextualizes an educational content into a meaningful and inspiring experience based on game-based and collaborative learning. This paper deals with the implementation of what we call educational escape game with the focus on the process dedicated to decontextualize the knowledge after a game session. We want to get a better understanding of debriefing so that practice can improve. The paper is based on an empirical study carried out with teachers/trainers experienced in implementing educational escape games. The paper is organized as follow. We (1) provide with a brief review of literature on debriefing and we argue for the adoption of the term “institutionalization”, a concept enabling to take into consideration the transformation of knowledge after a game session. We (2) propose a definition for educational escape-game based on a literature review and the systematic analysis of 2 French databases of educational escape games and (3) we discuss the results of an empirical work aiming at understanding how educators carry out the debriefing session which follows the time dedicated to play. According to our theoretical framework, debriefing consists of a process aiming at the transformation of the subjective and situated knowledge developed during the game into objective and transferable knowledge. Interviews and questionnaires conducted with three teachers enable to describe this process in terms of time (chronogenesis), role played by participants (topogenesis) and the settings (objects and relationships between objects) in which this process takes place (mesogenesis). These findings offer the opportunity for new guidelines for the design of debriefing sessions.},

The goal of SEG is not only to reinforce the knowledge and skills of students or to acquire them, but also to improve their intuition as to the choice of the skills to be mobilized according to the different situations. This methodology was implemented through an experiment carried out as part of a Masters combinatorial optimization course in an Engineering School, the aim of which was to increase the attractiveness of this very complex discipline manipulating a large number of digits. The evaluation of this experiment showed the advantages of this activity : manipulation of the notions in a playful way by the learners, increase of the motivation and improvement of their reactivity and practical sense.},

Initial attempts to measure self-regulated learning (SRL) using questionnaires and interviews were successful in demonstrating significant predictions of students’ academic outcomes. The present article describes the second wave of research, which has involved the development of online measures of self-regulatory processes and motivational feelings or beliefs regarding learning in authentic contexts. These innovative methods include computer traces, think-aloud protocols, diaries of studying, direct observation, and microanalyses. Although still in the formative stage of development, these online measures are providing valuable new information regarding the causal impact of SRL processes as well as raising new questions for future study.},

	abstract = {This chapter discusses the self-regulatory dimensions of academic learning and motivation. Educators have grown increasingly skeptical about explanations of learning and motivation that emphasize limitations of learners' abilities and social environmental backgrounds and have turned their attention to students' strategic efforts to manage their own achievement through specific beliefs and processes. Most current efforts to define the “self-regulation of academic learning” have adopted multidimensional criteria, which stress personal metacognitive, motivational, behavioral, and environmental processes used to enhance academic achievement. This chapter describes the self regulation of achievers and underachievers, dimensions of academic self regulation, and research on self-regulatory beliefs and processes in detail. The strategic qualities of self-regulated learners enable investigators to explain educational findings that conflict with fixed views of human functioning, such as exemplary achievement by minority students from disadvantaged backgrounds attending inner city schools as well as underachievement of youngsters from more fortunate backgrounds. The research on self-regulatory beliefs and processes may be divided into four sections such as, self-motivational techniques, self-regulatory methods and time management, self-regulation of performance, and regulating one's own physical and social environment. Students' use of learning strategies and self-monitoring of academic progress can strengthen their self-efficacy beliefs and intrinsic motivation.},

It represents a unique combination of learning theories once thought to be incompatible—active, problem-based learning activities founded upon a constructivist ideology and instructional lectures derived from direct instruction methods founded upon behaviorist principles.},

Instead, it is defined in terms of context-specific processes that are used cyclically to achieve personal goals. These processes entail more than metacognitive knowledge and skill; they also include affective and behavioral processes, and a resilient sense of self-efficacy to control them.

In Milsa, the students insert multiple questions and template answers, the questions aleatory distributed to multiple responses. Milsa was used as an assessment in a gamified discipline [1]. After the automatic correction of the questions, the students evaluate the responses. The correction algorithm in Milsa is based on LSA [2], on STASIS [3] and on Michalski's genetic algoritm [4]. The template answer is a tagged text: hyperonymy, hyponymy, meronymy and synonymy are marked. By the end the tests on are showed and evaluated.},

This outcome could result from gains in understanding during discussion, or simply from peer influence of knowledgeable students on their neighbors. To distinguish between these alternatives in an undergraduate genetics course, we followed the above exercise with a second, similar (isomorphic) question on the same concept that students answered individually. Our results indicate that peer discussion enhances understanding, even when none of the students in a discussion group originally knows the correct answer. In the classroom, discussion among students improves understanding and leads to more accurate answers to questions.

They focused especially on the importance of metacognition, which might be summarized as knowledge of one's own thoughts and the factors that influence one's thinking. Other researchers emphasize the ability to plan, monitor, and evaluate the learning process as key elements of metacognition. In creating scholarship of teaching and learning (SoTL) projects that documented their questions and interventions, and working as part of a group of scholars, collegium members reported becoming significantly more thoughtful about their teaching practice. The group found that metacognition was an effective tool for focusing students' attention more consciously on their learning and, ultimately, providing a means to encourage students to think about the larger purpose of their education. Perhaps as important, the collegium group found that by asking metacognitive questions of students, they became both more aware of their students' learning and increasingly self-reflective about their own teaching practices and effectiveness.},

	abstract = {Time spent in contact with academic course materials as a function of two testing schedules was measured using college undergraduates in an introductory educational psychology course. A within-subject (ABAB) design was employed with all subjects to allow for both individual and group analyses. A study room equipped with an adjacent observation room enabled visual and auditory monitoring of student study behavior. Academic materials were exclusively available to students in the study room and records of durations and distribution of student study time were made by an observer behind a one-way mirror. Daily testing produced consistent duration of study behavior with regular attendance at the study room; weekly and three-week testing produced sporadic bursts of study behavior and frequent instances of non-attendance. The amount of study behavior occurring in weekly and three-week testing conditions increased as the test time drew near (scalloping). Results suggest that daily testing supports more consistent study patterns than do the two larger intertest intervals investigated.},

	abstract = {Aim/Purpose: Educational robotics competitions are a popular way to increase students' interest in science and engineering during their K-12 years. However, female students are typically underrepresented in these competitions. The goal of this study is to determine differences in the experiences of male and female robotics competition students in order to better support female students and increase their representation in competition leagues. Background: VEX Robotics Competitions are one of the fastest-growing educational robotics competitions available to middle school and high school students around the world. Despite growing numbers of participants, VEX programs have a noticeable lack of female participants. In order to create a more diverse and representative program, it is important to investigate why fewer female students participate in the competitions and what can be done to better support female students. Methodology: Qualitative and quantitative data were collected from VEX mentors and students through online surveys. A total sample of N=675 VEX mentors and students participated (n=47 students and n=628 mentors). The surveys asked scaled, multiple choice, and free response questions. Through these surveys, the following research questions are answered: 1) What (if any) are the differences between male and female student experiences with VEX? 2) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' confidence in their technical ability? and 3) What (if any) are the differences in male and female students' performance on VEX related robotics team tasks?. Contribution: This study contributes to the growing body of work on engaging female students, and other underrepresented students, in STEM fields such as programming, engineering, and robotics.},

	abstract = {[EN] Today, the number of female students that enrol in degrees related to Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics (STEM) areas is quite low. So, numerous initiatives have arisen to promote these degrees and encourage female students in these areas. In this context, the EuLES Network (u-Learning Environments in Higher Education), an interdisciplinary network created in 2010 at the University of Zaragoza (Spain) to foster research, interaction, cooperation and transfer of knowledge and technologies related to learning and open education, has developed two projects oriented to High School Students: “WikinformáticA! en Aragon” and “Women in STEM by EuLES”. WikinformáticA! en Aragón is a competition for student groups in which they develop a wiki on prominent women in the history of Information and Communication Technology (ICT). The objective is the visibility of women involved in technology. The purpose of the Women in STEM project is to offer testimonies of women in Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics to encourage scientific vocations, especially in young people and girls. The project consists of conducting video interviews of women who work or study in these disciplines. All the videos, along with a short biography, are posted on the web.},

	abstract = {The gender gap in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) is regrettably universal and generally unacceptably broad. This phenomenon refers to women's underrepresentation in those fields, with the most significant disparities occurring in the critical fields of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science (EECS) and Information and Communication Technologies (ICT). The so-called pipeline problem contributes to this persisting gender gap, where women turn away from math and science at a young age due to negative stereotypes that cause them to believe they do not belong in STEM. All over the world, universities and organizations carry on initiatives to close this gap, showing varying degrees of success. Many of these programs focus on K-12 and high school girls, seeking to expose them to STEM-related activities to encourage girls' enrollment in STEM careers. Involving female teachers, and applying the role model approach, these programs offer in campus presentations, talks, or short courses aimed to break down stereotypes. In this article, we describe different sensibilization activities carried out at Facultad de Ingeniería (School of Engineering), Universidad de la República, Uruguay, to promote ICT careers in Uruguay. In particular, we present hands-on workshops for high school girls on robotics, electronic circuits, and geographic information systems on the occasion of the Girls in ICT Day.},

In particular, the gender gap is pronounced in the science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) fields at all levels of education and labour market. In those areas, the women participation remains low, although there are differences from country to country. In the Latin American context, there is a need for carrying out studies to collect quality data about the actual situation of women in STEM. Although some available data show a high proportion of women in Latin American university education, they are a minority in STEM programs. Moreover, this problem is particularly severe in Latin America because of the biases or cultural norms that influence female behaviour. In this context, the W-STEM project seeks to improve strategies and mechanisms for attracting, accessing, and guiding women in Latin America in STEM higher education programs. This work aims to describe the main results to prepare a set of attraction campaigns in secondary schools in the Latin American countries involved in the project (Chile, Colombia, Costa Rica, Ecuador, Mexico). In particular, a self-assessment tool about gender equality in higher education institutions in Latin America, an interview protocol for female role models, and a mobile application to show those role models.},

Para verificar os efeitos de período, coorte e idade utilizo modelos que permitem distinguir estes três efeitos temporais. O principal objetivo é analisar em que medida os ciclos de desenvolvimento e expansão econômica (até a segunda metade da década de 1970) e de estagnação e crise nas décadas de 1980 e 1990 são concomitantes às tendências populacionais de acesso à universidade e de entrada no mercado de trabalhos dos indivíduos com formação universitária.
