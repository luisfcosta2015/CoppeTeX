A gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom environment is proposed in this study. The objective of the study is to enhance students’ motivations, learning achievements and their perceptions of the designed environment. In the study, a true experimental design was used. The study was conducted with 61 undergraduate students taking a Physics-2 course. The experimental group students learned in the gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom environment, while the control group students learned with the ﬂipped classroom approach without a gamiﬁcation strategy. Data were collected from a physics motivation questionnaire, electromagnetism achievement test and semi structured interviews. The experimental results indicate that the students from the experimental group had a signiﬁcantly increased motivation for the classroom and learning achievements in comparison to the students in the control group. Moreover, it has been determined that the students’ opinions on the gamiﬁed classroom environment were positive. Additionally, the students interviewed stated that the approach had positive effects on their motivation for physics class. The results of this study can assist lecturers and instructors in integrating the gamiﬁcation strategy to the ﬂipped classroom approach.},

We present a study in which a college course was gamified, by including experience points, levels, badges, challenges and leaderboards. The study was five years long, where the first three were non-gamified years, and the last two regarded two successive experiments of our gamified approach. To assess how gamification impacted the learning experience, we compared data from both gamified and non-gamified years, using different performance measures. Results show significant improvements in terms of attention to reference materials, online participation and proactivity. They also suggest that our approach can reduce grade discrepancies among students and help them score better. Modeling course activities with game challenges and properly distributing those over the term seem to enhance this effect.},

	abstract = {Flipped learning can provide more in-class time for students to practice and apply knowledge and to receive feedback from peers and teachers. However, empirical studies have reported several problems that may occur with ﬂipped classroom activities, including the failure of students to access out-of-class learning materials. Students who do not complete out-of-class work beneﬁt little from the subsequent in-class discussion and problem-solving activities. This study oﬀers a new contribution by exploring whether gamiﬁcation could be a strategy to motivate students to participate in more out-of-class activities without forfeiting quality of work. We applied crucial aspects of ﬁve motivation theories to propose a goal-access-feedback-challenge-collaboration (GAFCC) gamiﬁcation design model. We then implemented and tested this theory-driven model in two quasi-experimental studies involving postgraduate students. Collective results from the two experiments revealed that (a) the GAFCC class completed signiﬁcantly more pre- and postclass activities than the control class and (b) the GAFCC class produced higher quality work than the control class. Participants’ perceptions of gamiﬁcation were also collected through interviews, and reported in this study. This evidence supports a call for further research into the use of the GAFCC model in ﬂipped classroom implementation.},

This study held an “understanding sequence” for 20 classes during the 7-week automation equipment class with 30 s year high school students in Incheon's specialized technical high school as target. After the class, the learning attitude of learners was measured through surveys and in-depth interviews. As a result, first, it was found that the degree of preparation participation in flip learning using gaming elements had a statistically significant increase from 65.56\% to 78.89\%, compared with the traditional flip learning using YouTube. Second, comparing the academic achievements showed a diagnostic assessment of 57.44 before applying the gaming elements and 20.17 after the application. However, for summative assessment, the degree after applying gaming elements was statistically higher at 84.52 than the degree before application, which was 78.86. Third, comparing academic achievement with word game results showed no significant correlation, and it is judged that all students were able to enjoy word games, regardless of their grades. Also, when the average word game scores were compared based on students’ grades, mid-upper level students had statistically significant higher scores than upper level students. Lastly, analysis on the correlation between attitude and word game showed that there is a quantitatively high correlation between the ranking system's competitive spirit and interest. The ranking system increased competitive spirit, as well as interest.},

Several studies state that the main limitations of the MOOCs are low completion and high dropout rates of participants. However, MOOCs suffer also from the lack of participant engagement, personalization, and despite the fact that several formats and types of MOOCs are reported in the literature, the majority of them contain a considerable amount of content that is mainly presented in a video format. This is in contrast to the results reported in other educational settings, where engagement and active participation are identiﬁed as success factors. We present the results of a study that involved educational experts and learning scientists giving new and interesting insights towards the conceptualization of a new design approach, the ﬂipped MOOC, applying the ﬂipped classroom approach to the MOOCs’ design and making use of gamiﬁcation and learning analytics. We found important indications, applicable to the concept of a ﬂipped MOOC, which entails turning MOOCs from mainly content-oriented delivery machines into personalized, interactive, and engaging learning environments. Our ﬁndings support the idea that MOOCs can be enriched by the orchestration of a ﬂipped classroom approach in combination with the support of gamiﬁcation and learning analytics.},

This instructional approach combines video-based learning outside the classroom and interactive group learning activities inside the classroom. The purpose of the present review is to provide an overview of flipped classroom studies in K-12 education. Particularly, we put emphasis on revealing and addressing the potential challenges of flipped classroom approach. Fifteen journal publications of K-12 flipped classrooms were analyzed in terms of their flipped learning activities, student achievement, student attitude, and challenges encountered. The results suggested that a variety of pre-class (e.g., online exercises) and in-class (e.g., brief review, individual practices) activities were provided in addition to instructional videos and small-group activities respectively. The use of flipped classroom approach in K-12 education yielded a neutral or positive impact on student achievement when compared to traditional classroom. Mixed results of student attitude toward flipped classroom approach were discovered. Challenges of implementing flipped classrooms were identified and categorized into student-related challenges, faculty challenges, and operational challenges. Based on the suggestions of previous studies together with relevant empirical supports, we propose a rudimentary flipped classroom model and a set of 10 guidelines to address these challenges. Finally, several recommendations of future research are provided.},

This storytelling template presents the stages of inner metamorphosis undergone by the protagonist after being called to an adventure. In a simpliﬁed version, this journey is divided into three acts separated by two crucial moments. Here we propose a discrete-time dynamical system for representing the protagonist’s evolution. The suffering along the journey is taken as the control parameter of this system. The bifurcation diagram exhibits stationary, periodic and chaotic behaviors. In this diagram, there are transition from ﬁxed point to chaos and transition from limit cycle to ﬁxed point. We found that the values of the control parameter corresponding to these two transitions are in quantitative agreement with the two critical moments of the three-act hero’s journey identiﬁed in 10 movies appearing in the list of the 200 worldwide highest-grossing ﬁlms.},

	abstract = {This study explores interactive digital storytelling in a university hybrid course. Digital stories leverage imagery and narrative-based content to explore concepts, while appealing to millennials. When digital storytelling is used as the main source of course content, tensions arise regarding how to engage and support student learning while holding them accountable for watching the video. We explore interactive video as a way to mitigate and engage with these issues. The context is a hybrid sustainability course for preservice teachers that used digital stories in a conventional format in which students could start, stop, and pause the video at will, as well as an interactive format with all the same features, plus programmed pauses for required understanding checks. A survey of students (n = 223) indicated they believed interactive digital stories supported engagement, scaffolded learning, and increased learning gains, but did not increase accountability. Evaluation of quiz performance indicated they recalled significantly more with interactive videos, compared to conventional videos. Implications for practice are discussed.},

Our findings give rise to a number of design criteria for e-Learning and blended course that address the motivation gap in order to increase the number students that are able to self-regulate their studies and stay or become motivated by the course as defined by Dan Pink’s motivational factors: autonomy, mastery and purpose [3].},

	abstract = {We evaluated the use of gamiﬁcation to facilitate a student-centered learning environment within an undergraduate Year 2 Personal and Professional Development (PPD) course. In addition to face-to-face classroom practices, an information technology-based gamiﬁed system with a range of online learning activities was presented to students as support material. The implementation of the gamiﬁed course lasted two academic terms. The subsequent evaluation from a cohort of 136 students indicated that student performance was signiﬁcantly higher among those who participated in the gamiﬁed system than in those who engaged with the nongamiﬁed, traditional delivery, while behavioral engagement in online learning activities was positively related to course performance, after controlling for gender, attendance, and Year 1 PPD performance. Two interesting phenomena appeared when we examined the inﬂuence of student background: female students participated signiﬁcantly more in online learning activities than male students, and students with jobs engaged signiﬁcantly more in online learning activities than students without jobs. The gamiﬁed course design advocated in this work may have signiﬁcant implications for educators who wish to develop engaging technology-mediated learning environments that enhance students’ learning, or for a broader base of professionals who wish to engage a population of potential users, such as managers engaging employees or marketers engaging customers.},

Just as a hero draws on different archetypes during the journey, a researcher moves through phases and must draw upon different strengths. In this article, the six archetypes that Pearson (1998) links to the hero’s journey are described. Then, each phase of a qualitative research study is described, followed by reflection on which of Pearson’s six archetypes were active. Discussion focuses on how other archetypes could have been helpful in each phase, as well as how other researchers could use this process of archetypal reflectivity to make their work more authentic and intentional.},

	abstract = {This is a pilot study aimed at examining students' learning performance and perceived motivation between a gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom and a non-gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom instructional model, based on the Self-Determination Theory (SDT). This study employed a mixed-method research approach, using three formative assessments or a post-test only design to examine students' learning achievement. Questionnaires and personal interviews were employed to support the data collection process in terms of students' perceived motivation. Fifty-six students were the respondents involved in a non-randomized experiment with a control group design. The results reveal that assessment 1 showed no signiﬁcant diﬀerence between the two groups of the gamiﬁed ﬂipped and non-gamiﬁed ﬂipped classroom instruction (t = 1.68, p.474), while assessment 2 and 3 were signiﬁcantly diﬀerent (t = 5.54, p = .007 {\textless} .05) and (t = 10.17, p = .001 {\textless} .05). In the present study, the ﬁndings conﬁrm that the students were positive regarding perceived competence, autonomy, and relatedness, better performance, and were able to achieve good achievement during the tests. The survey results reveal that the gamiﬁed ﬂip-class setting fostered better motivation and engagement. Particularly, students motivated to compete and beat other students during the gamiﬁcation activities by collecting points and badges as many as possible. Four main themes emerged from the qualitative interviews, namely, (1) pre-class learning motivation, (2) pre-class competition, (3) students' learning autonomy, and (4) students' social engagement. Conclusions from this study showed that the gamiﬁed ﬂip-class setting had successfully constructed the basic psychological needs of SDT, namely: competency, autonomy, and relatedness.},

It proposes the thesis that because people respond - instinctively and intuitively - to certain recurring story patterns and character archetypes, lawyers should systematically and deliberately integrate into their storytelling the larger picture of their clients' goals by subtly portraying their individual clients as heroes on a particular life path. This strategy is not merely a device to make the story more interesting but provides a scaffold to influence the judge at the unconscious level by providing a metaphor for universal themes of struggle and growth.},

These mechanics have been applied without reference to a theoretical model dedicated to this type of education. The objective of the paper is to propose a model for a gamified platform for online education that contributes to a more participatory learning, taking into account the different student profiles. Based on literature review about approaches to gamification systems design, a set of steps was followed in order to develop a generic model for a framework dedicated to online education. The model proposed is based on the Educational Gamification Design Principles proposed by Dicheva et al. (2015). The model may contribute to the promotion of participatory learning, taking into account the different student profiles. The results of such evaluation will be published in the future.},

	abstract = {Joseph Campbell is the mythographer of the last century who has congenially opened the mythological universe to both scholars and to a wide range of people searching for pathways to enlighten their lives. His elixir of life was to help people “see myth as a reflection of the one sublime adventure of life, and then to breathe new life into it” (Campbell, 2003, p. xiv). The hero’s journey is his gift, his “ultimate boon” (Campbell, 2008, p. 29) for the human condition and social world. It represents a universal motif which runs through virtually all kinds of change, transformation, and growth. The main objective of this special issue of the Journal of Genius and Eminence is to explore the multi-faceted potential of the hero’s journey and perhaps shed new light on it. The introduction gives an overview of Campbell’s ultimate boon and a summary of each of the 12 articles that follow. Distinguished scientists and outstanding practitioners have joined this journey in tribute to Campbell and the 30th anniversary of his death. The contributors take us far and wide, exploring different ways to explore Campbell’s thoughts, allowing insights into the nuances and subtleties of his mythological world, and striking new ways to illuminate the Campbellian universe.},

@article{vold_flipped_nodate,
	title = {Flipped {Gaming}: {The} {Teachers} {Role} {When} {Using} the {Students} as {Content} {Providers}},
	abstract = {In order to activate students and make them active contributors in a class, the concept of “Flipped Classroom” has been used at several Universities, also at The Inland University of Applied Sciences Norway. Flipping the classroom and making the students contribute, and being active, has supported the students learning outcome. Generally, when using games for learning, the game scenario is either decided by the lecturer/teacher, or defined by the designers and/or producers of the game used. In this paper we will explore how the teachers/lecturers role changes when the scenarios to be played in the game environment are defined and developed by the students themselves. The methodological approach is mainly qualitative and the data are observations from gaming sessions, minutes from review processes and interviews with faculty staff responsible for the course. The paper will present how the lecturer/teacher changes role from being the center of attention and the provider of knowledge, to a facilitator that both empower the students and enables the students to contribute towards developing increased understanding and enhanced learning outcome. By enabling the students to contribute in such a way, the support towards the reflection processes described by Donald Schön in his work “The reflective practitioner” from 1991, is being supported in all stages. The reflection before action is when they discuss and agree on scenario, they need to reflect in action upon action, and they need to reflect on action when finished gaming. These reflection processes need to be facilitated in order to support the learning process and when flipping the gaming, this is one of the roles of the facilitator; the lecturer/teacher. The paper will present a project called “Seed corn 2017 – Pedagogical Use of Games in Crisis Management Education”, using a course at The Inland Norway University of Applied Sciences, Campus Rena, Norway, and the results from the research.},

@article{zhang_archetype_nodate,
	title = {Archetype and {Allegory} in {Journey} to the {West}},
	abstract = {The Journey to the West (西游记) is one of the masterworks of classic Chinese fiction. It was written by Wu Cheng‘en (吴承恩) in the 16th century CE. Many of the scholars, both Chinese and Western, who have studied the narrative of this Ming era (1368-1644) novel, have considered it to be an epic of myth and fantasy, heavily laden with allegorical meaning. Most scholars have chosen to interpret the novel by means of an encompassing framework of meaning rooted in the convergence of the teachings of Buddhism, Taoism and Confucianism. I propose to look at the Journey’s narrative structure as a heroic adventure or monomyth of the kind proposed by Joseph Campbell, following the insights of Carl Jung on the nature of the collective unconscious. To analyze the component parts of the quest story that forms the bulk of the novel‘s narrative, I shall turn to Vladimir Propp‘s categorization of the functioning of elements of plot and character in his morphology of folktales. I shall also argue that the Journey is not an allegory that serves the beliefs and practices of a number of religions and philosophies, but a specifically Buddhist allegory. The Journey is seen as intentionally composed of symbols, images, and codes that function to project a heroic adventure with a complex pattern of meaning, primarily representing the eternal human struggle for identity and a fully realized existence, that are Buddhist in nature.},

We propose that heroes and hero narratives fulﬁll important cognitive and emotional needs, including the need for wisdom, meaning, hope, inspiration, and growth. We propose a framework called the heroic leadership dynamic (HLD) to explain how need-based heroism shifts over time, from our initial attraction to heroes to later retention or repudiation of heroes. Central to the HLD is idea that hero narratives fulﬁll both epistemic and energizing functions. Hero stories provide epistemic beneﬁts by providing scripts for prosocial action, by revealing fundamental truths about human existence, by unpacking life paradoxes, and by cultivating emotional intelligence. To energize us, heroes promote moral elevation, heal psychic wounds, inspire psychological growth, and exude charisma. We discuss the implications of our framework for theory and research on heroism, leadership processes, and positive psychology.},

	abstract = {Purpose – Gamification is the application of game features, mainly video game elements, into non-game context for the purpose of promoting motivation and engagement in learning. The application of gamification in a pedagogical context provides some remedy for many students who find themselves alienated by traditional methods of instruction. The use of gamification could provide a partial solution to the decline in learners’ motivation and engagement the schooling system is facing today. Specifically, the college environment could benefit a lot from gamifying not only their graduate recruitment strategies, but also the college course content and curricula. This critical analysis of literature on gamification is intended to be part of a sequence on the effect of gamification on motivation and engagement. A proposed methodology in the study of gamification effect on motivation and engagement in addition to an empirical study on three college courses are being finalized to complete this trilogy. The paper aims to discuss these issues.},

	abstract = {This collection engages with questions of influence, a vexed and problematic concept whose intellectual history is both ancient and vast. It examines a range of texts written in French, sometimes in dialogue with visual/musical works, drawn mainly from the eighteenth century onwards. Connections are made with related work in a range of disciplines. Questions of Influence is a major contribution to, and updating of, our understanding of the ways in which 'influence' works not only in literature but also in other art-forms, and in relationships between these. Exploring 'influence' in a newly sophisticated way, the book draws on a wide range of European writers, artists and thinkers, and showcases numerous talented critics working at the cutting edge of their fields. It will be indispensable both for those working on the individual figures who form the case studies of the book and for those who want to re-conceptualise the slippery concept of influence and the lateral, as well as direct, modes in which it operates. Each chapter is beautifully presented and lucidly argued, and the whole book demonstrates remarkable intellectual versatility and orginality.},

This paper reviews the role of motivation in the context of the strength, or limited-resource, model of self-control in several domains. Sacrificing one desire in order to pursue another is more difficult when the incipient response is strongly motivated, a notion that highlights the struggle between urges and restraints. A reduction in ego resources can be temporarily overcome by strong motivation – nevertheless, ego depletion is not solely a loss of motivation: Recent experiments indicate that regulatory resources are rooted in physical energy stores. Motivational conflicts, especially the clash between selfish motives and behaviors that promote social acceptance, set the stage for the necessity of self-regulation and the circumstances in which ego depletion is most likely.},

	abstract = {In human-computer interaction, the trend towards gamiﬁcation is part of the shift of focus from usability to the more holistic approach of user experience. Gamiﬁcation is "the use of game elements in non-game contexts" and is increasingly used in a variety of domains such as crowd sourcing, health care, sustainability, sports and learning. In today’s Internet, consumer loyalty is low and high expectations are placed upon positive effects of gamiﬁcation. Despite its widespread use, only a small number of studies have examined the phenomenon empirically and it is still unclear if and how gamiﬁcation is able to live up to expectations. A promising approach is to study gamiﬁcation from the perspective of motivation theories. The extensive research on rewards and research in the ﬁeld of video games makes the theory of self-determination a viable starting point. Likewise, the concept of ﬂow has strengths when it comes to designing for an optimal user experience and usability. Following the approach of self-determination theory, the possible effects of personal, situational and contextual factors will be discussed and recommendations for design and possible research will be given.},

	abstract = {Instruction in English is a priority around the globe, but instructional methodologies have not always kept pace with the changing needs of students. To explore the beneﬁts of the ﬂipped classroom model for learners of English as a Foreign Language, the researchers used ﬂipped learning and Wen’s Output-driven/Input-enabled model to design a holistic oral training course that included extensive online written and verbal communication for the learning of a wide range of English idioms. The participants were 48 sophomore English majors in two required English oral training classes. A within-subjects research design exposed all participants to learning English idioms by ﬂipped learning, using the LINE smartphone app, and by conventional instruction. A mixed research method was employed, using multiple sources of data collection, including pre- and post-tests on idioms, two questionnaires (“Perception of Flipped Learning Experience” and “Technology Acceptance Model”), the teachers’ in-class observations, and semi-structured focus-group interviews. The results revealed that the theory-based ﬂipped instruction using online written and oral interaction not only enhanced the participants’ motivation, making them more active in using idioms in class, but also signiﬁcantly improved their idiomatic knowledge, indicating that the ﬂipped learning was successful in achieving the instructional goals of the class. The authors present insights into the impact of theory-based ﬂipped learning on motivation and idiomatic acquisition; student impressions of the online platform used, LINE; and offer recommendations for practice.},

Various studies point in different directions. However, blended learning outperforms the traditional classroom in student performance and satisfaction. A ﬂipped classroom is one type of blended learning. For more than 20 years, this approach has been used at a European executive MBA (EMBA) program delivering online content combined with six residential weeks where students collaborate and reﬂect upon their online learning. Our research examined the overall setup of this program, and assessed one course in depth. As part of the course—International Management—an intercultural negotiation project was chosen to highlight the integration of online and ofﬂine activities. The ﬂipped classroom is a demonstration of the reform-based teaching approach. The power of reform-based learning in executive education is the engaging combination of practice and theory, which improves the performance of executives. The participants considered the ﬂipped approach exciting, dynamic, and insightful. The emphasis on a negotiation process involving classmates from around the world increased their global understanding. Beginning with a negotiation experience in the digital story project gave them a better appreciation of the relevant theories, techniques, and applications. Focusing on the practice of international negotiation and a cross-cultural analysis with reﬂection on cultural intelligence improved the competencies of the participants both during the course and after it.},

The study presents a reference matrix for gamification applications based on a framework of game elements (dynamics, mechanics and components) seeking relations with segments/application areas that could make use of the gamification process. Besides the bibliographical research, some Grounded Theory techniques were used to gather, prepare and analyze data. Intermediate matrices allowed the discussion about aspects related to components, mechanics and game dynamics and the different segments/areas identified. The main matrix may serve as a reference model for gamification applications bearing in mind that different sets of elements may be combined in various ways; and that each segment/area has a potential set of combinations that depend on the clarity of business objectives. For example, the use of the "narratives" dynamics in the Education and Training segment could help not only the players, but also the developers regarding the stimulus, motivation and engagement needed to promote a teaching/learning process. Within the context of information architecture, the game mechanics is the critical element for engagement underpinning the play style and working directly on the user's perception. Future studies may add to this matrix previous information from users - which would affect the development of gamification applications - as well as information derived from the activity of the players, as cutouts towards a wide strategic proposal.},

This may lead to the insufficient design and use of serious games as well as gamified applications. Since the development of such applications is usually expensive, high costs and few realized benefits might result. In order to avoid such unfavorable outcomes, it is necessary to understand the underlying mechanisms that lead to learning and motivation. For this purpose, this study reviews research articles describing the use of games and game elements beyond entertainment and outlines their theoretical foundations. Based on the resulting insights, several theory-driven design guidelines for game-based learning and motivation are derived. This study therefore equips researchers with theoretical insights on how games and game elements facilitate learning and motivation, and practitioners with theory-driven design guidelines for their design and evaluation.},

The ego/ persona is incomplete and longing for the gift of completion, the shadow is the gift giver, and the anima is the gift. Here we begin to see the symbolism in humanity’s great myths of the dramas being played out between ego, persona, shadow, and anima/ animus. In our mythic stories, the one who stands between the hero and the treasure often mysteriously becomes, in fact, the gift giver: obstructing dragon guardian transforms into knowledgeable guide. With the treasure come new challenges, however; the hero can project any of these elements outwardly onto people or institutions and become entangled, or the seeker’s ego can identify with the successful search and become inflated. Or, following a path of transformation to a higher stage of human development, the hero can integrate the previously hidden and unknown depths of self.},

This method allowed to know what the students did not understand after trying to study the instructive materials assigned to them. To achieve that the students work before class methods of marketing and gamification were developed. Methods for the analysis of student responses were also developed. The JiTT method allowes the teacher know in advance those aspects that are most interesting or most dificult to understand for the students as well as their most urgent doubts. Finally, we have developed methods to use the urgent doubts of the students to generate formative feedback and activities to do in the classroom. In the method named “flipped learning forte” the teacher answer the urgent doubts of his students. In the method named ‘flip in colours’ the teacher classify the doubts by their posible utility in the classroom using a color code. With the combined application of these methods in university courses the failure rate of the students has decreased and the mean grade in the exams for the assessment of learning has increased in more than one standard deviation. The rate of students that attain the level of mastery has increased, as well as the student evaluations about the teachers of these courses. Finally, the reasons underlying the efficacy of the proposed flipped method are discussed.},

	abstract = {Interactive digital storytelling is becoming a popular choice for information presentation in many fields. Its application spans from the media industry and business information visualization, through digital cultural heritage, serious games, education, to contemporary theater and visual arts. The benefits of this form of multimedia presentation in education are generally recognized, and several studies which explore and support the opinion have been conducted. In addition to discussing the benefits, we wanted to address the challenges of introducing interactive digital storytelling and serious games in the classroom. The challenge of the inherent ambiguity of edutainment, due to opposing features of education and entertainment, is augmented with different viewpoints of multidisciplinary team members. We specifically address the opposing views on artistic liberty, at one side, and technical constraints and historical facts, on the other. In this paper, we present the first findings related to these questions and hope to initiate further discussions in this area.},

	abstract = {Instructors and the teaching practices they employ play a critical role in improving student learning in college science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) courses. Consequently, there is increasing interest in collecting information on the range and frequency of teaching practices at department-wide and institution-wide scales. To help facilitate this process, we present a new classroom observation protocol known as the Classroom Observation Protocol for Undergraduate STEM or COPUS. This protocol allows STEM faculty, after a short 1.5-hour training period, to reliably characterize how faculty and students are spending their time in the classroom. We present the protocol, discuss how it differs from existing classroom observation protocols, and describe the process by which it was developed and validated. We also discuss how the observation data can be used to guide individual and institutional change.},
